There are three features of my project:

• Interactive Donation Cart:
When you click on a donation cart, it reveals its details. Additionally, clicking on the donation button will add the selected item to the donation cart.

• Donation Percentage Visualization:
The pie chart visually represents the proportion of donations made compared to the total donations received.

• Category-based Search:
Searching by category name displays individual category cards, each separately showcasing its contents.
